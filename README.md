I am Brian Ibrahim Qamardeen. Welcome to my GitHub space.

ABOUT ME (SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING-WISE)
------------------------------------
Brian is a software engineer with a special ability that enables him to come to
precise realization of his clientâ€™s dream, in a way that is: pleasing to the
client, money-efficient, and time-efficient. If he detects issues with the
dream, he makes attempts to refine it with the client. Afterwards, he proceeds
to efficiently (money-wise and time-wise) create a software that perfectly
satisfies the dream.

Brian understands and has repeatedly experienced the whole software engineering
life-cycle. He has filled in a lot of software engineering roles, including:
project management, software architecture,
software core engineering (back-end engineering),
interface engineering (front-end engineering), and software maintenance.

Brian is open to working with entities that understand what they are doing.
